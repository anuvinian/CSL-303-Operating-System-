Operating System Scripts and Scheduling Algorithms
This repository contains shell scripts and Python programs for various operating system tasks and scheduling algorithms.

Contents
Shell Scripts
greatest3.sh: Determines the largest of three numbers.
gross_salary.sh: Calculates gross salary based on base salary, HRA, and DA.
hello.sh: Displays a simple greeting.
instruct.sh: Menu-driven script for executing system commands (ls, ps, date).
num_to_day.sh: Maps a number (1-7) to a weekday.
odd_even.sh: Checks if a number is odd or even.
palindrome.sh: Determines if a number is a palindrome.
prime.sh: Checks if a number is prime.
fib.sh: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term count.
avg.sh: Calculates the average of a series of numbers.
factorial.sh: Computes the factorial of a given number.
Scheduling Algorithms
fcfs.java: Implements First-Come, First-Served scheduling.
sjf.java: Implements Shortest Job First scheduling (non-preemptive).
srtf.java: Implements Shortest Remaining Time First scheduling (preemptive).
simple_Priority_Scheduling.java: (preemptive)
Usage
Shell Scripts:

Run by entering ./script_name.sh in the terminal after setting permissions (chmod +x script_name.sh).
Follow prompts for user input.
Scheduling Algorithms:

Each Java script accepts process IDs, burst times, and arrival times as input.
Outputs include a Gantt chart, average waiting time, and average turnaround time.
